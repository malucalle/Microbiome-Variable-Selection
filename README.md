**Abstract:**
Though variable selection is one of the most relevant tasks in microbiome analysis, e.g. for
the identification of microbial signatures, many studies still rely on methods that ignore the
compositional nature of microbiome data. The applicability of compositional data analysis
methods has been hampered by the availability of software and the difficulty in interpreting
their results. This work is focused on three methods for variable selection that acknowledge
the compositional structure of microbiome data: selbal, a forward selection approach for the
identification of compositional balances, and clr-lasso and coda-lasso, two penalized
regression models for compositional data analysis. This study highlights the link between
these methods and brings out some limitations of the centered log-ratio transformation for
variable selection. In particular, the fact that it is not subcompositionally consistent makes the
microbial signatures obtained from clr-lasso not readily transferable. Coda-lasso is
computationally efficient and suitable when the focus is the identification of the most
associated microbial taxa. Selbal stands out when the goal is to obtain a parsimonious model
with optimal prediction performance, but it is computationally greedy. We provide a
reproducible vignette for the application of these methods that will enable researchers to fully
leverage their potential in microbiome studies
